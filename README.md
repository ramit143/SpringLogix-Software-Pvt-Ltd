Assignment React
This is a React web application for storing user profiles in a MongoDB database. The application uses Node.js and Express for the server-side code, and Axios for making HTTP requests from the client-side.

Installation
To run this application, you need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages by running npm install in the project directory.
3. Start the MongoDB server by running mongod in a terminal window.
4. Start the Node.js server by running npm start in the project directory.



=>Usage:->
Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

2. Clone the project repository from your terminal or command prompt by running the command:

git clone <repository-url>


3. Navigate to the project directory using the command:

cd assignment-react


4. Install the required dependencies using the command:

npm install

5. Start the development server by running the command:

npm start
This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000/

Any changes made to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

6. To stop the server, press "Ctrl + C" in your terminal or command prompt.




To start the server in your assignment, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window in the root directory of your project.
2. Run the command npm start or node index.js to start the server.
3. The server should now be running and listening for incoming requests at the port specified in your code (in this case, port 5000).
4. You can test the server by sending requests to its endpoints using a tool like Postman or a web browser.
